# Single-Repo Setup

In this example, you will find suggested documents for a single repository. These documents are meant to be the foundational documents required for a single repository, allowing developers to immediately start developing and deploying features without distracting others. If you have suggestions on how we could improve this example, please open a Pull Request and offer feedback.

In this example, templates are provided for all of the following:

* How to set your local environment

* How to contribute to the repository

* How to deploy your code

* How to contact the repo owner

> \[!NOTE]
>
> This is meant to be an example and can be adjusted for your use case. Please follow the instructions below to add to your JoggrSetup.

## Step 1: Download the Zip File

Download the zip file called "single-repo-compressed.zip": <https://github.com/joggrdocs/docs-templates/blob/main/examples/single-repo/single-repo-compressed.zip>

## Step 2: Add the Zip File to your Repository

1. Unzip the file(s)

2. Add the file(s) to your repository

3. Organize the templates into the correct directory tree

4. Open a Pull Request for these changes and merge.

> \[!IMPORTANT]
>
> You must merge these changes to the default branch or you cannot complete the following steps.

## Step 3: Import Docs to Joggr

To get the power of Joggr (keeping your docs up to date), you must import them to your Joggr Workspace. Use our docs [to import](https://docs.joggr.io/guides/import-docs) the templates you added to your repository in Step 2.

## ðŸŽ‰ Done

You now have set up your repository with all the necessary templates. Please review our documentation on [Code Snippets](https://docs.joggr.io/platform/code-snippets) and [Code Links](https://docs.joggr.io/platform/code-links) to learn more about how Joggr can help you keep your docs up to date.
