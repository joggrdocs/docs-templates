## Overview

As a documentation startup, we understand the importance of having great documentation. We live by three core rules with our documentation standards:

1. **You cannot tell who wrote the document, only that someone on the Joggr team did.**

2. **You can easily grok what a document is based on its name and summary.**

3. **You automatically know where you should be able to find a document based on what you are looking for (aka it's in the right directory).**

If we follow these 3 core rules and our overall standards it will allow our team to:

* ðŸš€ **Move faster** - great docs help devs work independently and not get bogged down in question hell.

* ðŸ›¹ **Onboard faster** - when you have great docs new devs can easily get up to speed and start contributing.

* ðŸ”® **Be kind to your *Future Self*** - you will eventually write super complex code and you won't remember why. If you write great docs you can thank your past self for helping you untangle whatever spaghetti is in front of you.

Please read this document, and apply it to your documentation writing at Joggr! In this document, you will find all of the following:

* **Directory Structure Standards**: outlines what documents go where in Joggr.

* **When to Create Documentation:** our standards on when to create certain types of documentation.

* **How to Create Documentation**: our standards on how to create, including how to write great titles and summaries, and if to use a template or not.

* **Where to Save Documentation:** our standards on where certain types of documentation should be saved.

## Directory Structure Standards

Below is a table that includes the structure of our directories, including a description of the directory and what it should contain.

| Folder                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Technology Component Structure

Certain directories within the `Technology` directory will be considered a Technology Component that will contain a shared structure. This is used to break apart the Technology documentation by service & team, allowing for a modularized approach to documentation that also follows a shared standard. In the Joggr context (our team), a Technology Component almost always lines up with either a single mono repository or a `app` within a repository. Below are the Component Structure standards. Not all directories are required as some Tech will not need a certain directory.

| Directory      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Guides`       | How-to guides or other related documents that will explain how to complete a task.                                                                                                                                                 |
| `Architecture` | Documents that show how something is architected, including items such as workflows and diagrams.                                                                                                                                  |
| `Libraries`    | Generalized documentation for reusable code that is shared within the component. Depending on the context this could be called `Plugins` (Fastify), `Middleware` (Express), `Hooks` (React), `Components` (React) and many others. |
| `Packages`     | A special directory is used for our mono repositories that include `npm` packages that are scoped to the repository (but can still be published). This is to delineate from other forms of shared code.                            |

## Standards for Documentation

Standards ("Rules") are defined logic that you can apply to a document or point during the SDLC to help you validate you are writing documentation that meets our standards. Below you will find standards for all of the following:

* **When to Create Documentation**

* **How to Create Documentation**

* **Where to Save Documentation**

**Note**: Rules will be integrated into the Joggr Rules Engine in the future, for now, please read through each rule carefully and ensure you follow them.

### Global

These rules apply to every category of documentation.
