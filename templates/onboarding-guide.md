## Engineering

We have a lot of work to do and can use more hands-on keyboard-crushing code. Our core goal is to get you to your first commit but there are a couple of steps you need to knock out before you can start committing code.

Please work through each section before you start to take on any tasks:

1. Access

2. Documentation

3. Your first commit

### Access

Follow the steps below to get access to the core systems you need so you can start committing code. This will not include all systems but the primary ones you need to start committing code!

#### Google Cloud Platform

You will need access to Google Cloud (GCP) to run the applications locally and to do any sort of actual testing in staging. You will be assigned a role based on your role within the organization, most engineers will receive the basic ENTER ROLE NAME role that will give them access to the Development environment group environments (click [here](https://app.joggr.io) to learn more about environments).

Follow the steps below to get access to GCP:

1. If you don't have access to GCP request one from IT

2. Visit the [local GCP environment](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome?project=development-395517)

3. Login using Google Social Sign-on if you aren't already logged in

4. You should see the Google Cloud dashboard

5. â›… You are all set!

#### GitHub

You will need access to GitHub to commit code. You will be assigned a GitHub team based on your role within the organization, most engineers will be assigned to the [Product team](https://github.com) which will give them limited write access to the core repositories.

Follow the steps below to get access to GitHub:

1. If you don't have an invite to our GitHub accounts request one from IT

2. You will need to [setup MFA](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication) if you don't already have it setup

3. Visit the [Our GitHub account](https://github.com), you should see a handful of repositories & our README

4. â›… You are all set!

### Slack

You will need to join certain channels in Slack as an engineer, please join the channels below:

* [#slack-channel-one](https://slack.com)

* [#slack-channel-two](https://slack.com)

* [#slack-channel-three](https://slack.com)
