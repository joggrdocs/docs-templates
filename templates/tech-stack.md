## Overview

At ENTER_COMPANY, our primary goal when selecting a technology stack was and is to provide our team with the ability to do their jobs efficiently and without unnecessary roadblocks or processes.

To meet that goal we made some opinionated decisions:

1. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is the **ONLY** language in use (outside of some vanilla JavaScript)

2. [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/) as our **ONLY** API framework

3. [Pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino) as our **ONLY** logging utility

4. [React](https://react.dev/) & [MUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/) our **ONLY** frontend component libraries

These technologies are used across the board, be it frontend or backend. This means a frontend developer can add an API using TypeScript or even add a Cloud Storage bucket using [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/languages-sdks/javascript/).

## üéØ Core
